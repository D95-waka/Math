\question{}
\begin{definition}
	Let $X$ be a set. A tree $T$ is set such that,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For every $\eta \in T$, $\eta$ is a function from an ordinal $\alpha$ to $X$.
		\item If $\eta \in T$ and $\dom \eta = \alpha > \beta$ then $\eta \restriction \beta \in T$.
	\end{enumerate}
	If $X = 2$ then we say that $T$ is binary tree. \\
	The height of $T$ is the least ordinal $\alpha$ such that $\forall \eta \in T, \dom \eta < \alpha$.
	We define $\operatorname{Lev}(\eta) = \dom \eta$ (the level of $\eta$), and we denote $T_\alpha = \{\eta \in T \mid \operatorname{Lev}(\eta) = \alpha\}$.
	For $\eta, \eta' \in T$ we define $\eta \le_T \eta'$ if $\eta = \eta' \restriction \dom \eta$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let $\kappa$ be a regular cardinal, we say that a tree $T$ is a $\kappa$-tree if the height of $T$ is $\kappa$ and for every $\alpha < \kappa$, $|T_\alpha| < \kappa$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let $T$ be a tree of height $\alpha$.
	A function $b : \alpha \to X$ is a cofinal branch in $T$ if for every $\beta < \alpha$, $b \restriction \beta \in T$.
	We would also use the term cofinal branch for the set $\{ b \restriction \beta \mid \beta < \alpha \}$.
\end{definition}

Let $\kappa$ be an infinite regular cardinal.
Let $T$ be a binary $\kappa$-tree.

We will prove that there is $T' \subseteq T$ of height $\kappa$ such that for every $\alpha < \beta < \kappa$ and $x \in T'$ with $\operatorname{Lev}(x) = \alpha$,
there is $y \in T'$ with $\operatorname{Lev}(y) = \beta$ and $x \le_T y$.
\begin{proof}
	The assumption that this condition isn't met at all will lead to $T$ being of height less than $\kappa$, then there are such elements in $T$.
	Why can't we just take an arbitrary $\kappa$ branch, this would create some linear order of order $\kappa$ and would satisfy the proposition.
\end{proof}

\question{}
We will show that every binary $\omega$-tree has a cofinal branch.
\begin{proof}
	It is direct by the definition of height of a tree.
	From the last question, we can assume $T' \subseteq T$ fulfills the property of arbitrary elements, then we will define recursively the function $b : \omega \to X$ by the following,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $b(0) = \eta(0)$, when $\eta$ is any branch $\in T$ (the root of ordered tree is unique).
		\item For every $0 \le n < \omega$, let $b \restriction n + 1 = x$ when $x \in T', \operatorname{Lev}(x) = n + 1$ such that $b \restriction n \le_T x$, given by the last question.
	\end{enumerate}
	This recursive definition ensures us that for every $\alpha < \omega$, indeed $b \restriction \alpha \in T' \subseteq T$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\question{}
We will prove that if there is some cardinal $\mu$ such that $\mu^+ < \kappa$ and $|T_\alpha| \le \mu$ for all $\alpha$, then $T$ has a cofinal branch.
